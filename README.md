# Mental health is a vital aspect of overall well-being, and early identification of mental health conditions can enable timely support and intervention. This project focuses on sentiment analysis of textual data to predict individuals' mental health status based on their statements. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the goal is to classify statements into one of seven mental health categories:

Normal
Depression
Suicidal
Anxiety
Stress
Bi-Polar
Personality Disorder

# The insights derived from this analysis could be instrumental for mental health professionals in providing early and targeted support to those in need.
